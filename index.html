                            We will provide you with access to electronic account statements or send you paper account statements regularly as specified in the product features of each account. You agree to review each account statement regularly (at least once every 30 days) and your savings account transactions at least once every 90 days. Please note that electronic statements will not be sent to you, so you agree to access and review your account activity through online banking, telephone banking or President's Choice Financial and CIBC bank machines.
                            <br />
                            You will write, phone or contact us via online banking within 90 days of any savings account transaction date (or the date the transaction should have occurred) and within 30 days after the statement date for any other account if you believe the statement or transaction history is wrong. If you don't contact us, then with the exception of incorrect credits made by us to your account:

                            In the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, our liability will be no greater than the amount of the item or the direct damages you have suffered. We are not liable for any indirect, special or consequential damages.
                            <br />
                            You may not be held responsible for cheques that you signed and which have forged or unauthorized endorsements but only if you notify us within 30 days after you learn about the problem and you prove to our satisfaction that you took all reasonable steps to prevent the situation.
